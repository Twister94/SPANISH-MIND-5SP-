POLYGLOT MIND & LANGUAGE INTERACTIONS - ITALIAN MIND 
----------------------------------------------------

A new language project has come on Github ! üçæüçæüçæüçæüçæüçæ 

Welcome ! This project will link up all knowledge in foreign languages to help you to sharpen your language skills. It is design for who start studying a language and want to reach an advanced level. Knowing a second language is crucial in our world. With this second language, you will catch new opportunities. 

Caution ! This method doesn't guarantee that tomorrow you may hold a conversation with politians about globalization and global warming. Otherwise it guarantees that you have all tools and information at the same place. If you work smart and you repeat many times... you will approach mastery quickly. 

Some recomendations before starting the trip :
- Define a vision and good language learning habits. Evalue the level of difficulty to change and sacrifice.

- Know how to work with the pack "Obisidian & Git & Github" and master it .
  - Reminder for Obsidian : 
    - Create a note.
    - Create a link between two notes.
    - Add a record into a note
    - Create a lecture note adding some metadatas and hastags **following standards**
    - Create a MOC note adding some metadatas and hastags **following standards**
    - **Use to split a MOC note into permanant notes with Note Refactor plug-in**
  
  - Reminder for Git :
   - To save your work/changes : 
     - Open your git bash  
     - Hit git add .
     - Hit git commit -m "New Update (Today date)" or git commit -m "The comment you want" 
     - Hit git push
   - To pull all the repository on Github into your laptop : 
     - Open your git bash  
     - Hit git checkout    
     - Hit git pull    

- Fix a time slot (10 min, 30 min, 1 hour or 3 hours) for working on some bulletpoints. I share you my timetable for example :






- During your working session, use all your senses to stimulate your memory (Eyes are not this only way). Find the best for memorizing the information in front of you. Start again the process when you want to keep in mind an other information
  - Record your voice and hear the result.
  - Buy a notebook and write it down. Sometimes your brain need to slow down for integrate deeply what you want 
-  Evaluate after your session and if you don't have the time, do it before sleeping.
-  Share your modified notes by pushing them on Github with "git push".

For more details, please read some notes below : 
- "The Why of the repository" to know the reason I wanted to start writing all notes
- "The How of the repository" to know the way 
- "The What of the repository" to visualize the result with your imagination.
- "Pre-requests for the repository" to evalue if you are able to contribute to this repository. 

Please be honest and ask yourself. It's not a problem if you don't contribue to this repository. I don't want to loose your time and my time.

Peace & Love
